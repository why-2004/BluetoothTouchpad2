# BluetoothTouchpad2

Bluetooth-HID stuff. 

Requires Android 9+

Don't ask why it's BluetoothTouchpad 2. It is 2 for a reason.

many thanks to https://github.com/raghavk92/Kontroller for some BLE implementations.

I recommend you use the version of this app with better UI (https://github.com/why-2004/AndroidController) if you plan to use this for gaming.
